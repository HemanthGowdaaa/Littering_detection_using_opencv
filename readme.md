Below is the content for a README file that includes the steps to create a virtual environment, activate it, install the required packages, and run the detection script.

# Detection Project

This project performs object detection for littering thrown out of cars using EasyOCR and SQLite for data management.

## Setup Instructions

Follow the steps below to set up the environment and run the detection:

### Step 1: Create a Virtual Environment

Create a virtual environment using the following command:

```bash
python3 -m venv env
```

### Step 2: Activate the Virtual Environment

Activate the virtual environment with the following command:

- On macOS/Linux:
  ```bash
  source ./env/bin/activate
  ```

- On Windows:
  ```bash
  .\env\Scripts\activate
  ```

### Step 3: Install Requirements

Install the required packages using the following command:

```bash
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

### Step 4: Run the Detection Script

Run the detection script with the following command:

```bash
python3 main.py
```

## Additional Information

- Ensure that `requirements.txt` contains all the necessary Python packages for the project.
- The `main.py` script should be the entry point for running your detection logic.

## Deactivating the Virtual Environment

To deactivate the virtual environment, simply run:

```bash
deactivate
```

## Troubleshooting

- If you encounter SSL certificate issues, especially on macOS, you might need to install certificates using the following command:
  ```bash
  /Applications/Python\ 3.x/Install\ Certificates.command
  ```
  Replace `3.x` with your installed Python version.

## Project Structure

Ensure your project directory has the following structure:

```
project/
├── env/
├── main.py
├── requirements.txt
└── README.md
```

- `env/`: The virtual environment directory (created in Step 1).
- `main.py`: The main script to run the detection.
- `requirements.txt`: File containing the list of required Python packages.
- `README.md`: This README file.
